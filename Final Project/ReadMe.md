# NYC Taxi Services Analysis

## Overview
This repository contains the Data Science Fundamentals final project, analyzing NYC taxi services, including yellow cabs and For-Hire Vehicles (Uber & Lyft). The project utilizes datasets from NYC Open Data to uncover usage patterns, geospatial trends, and socio-economic impacts of taxi services.

## Repository Structure
- `data/` - Contains raw datasets used for analysis.
- `documents/` - Project reports and related documents.
- `trail-data/` - Data used for trial analyses.
- `CSE 519 - Data Science Fundamentals - Final.ipynb` - Jupyter notebook with data exploration and analysis.
- `CSE 519 - Project Progress Report.docx` - Progress report document.
- `ML Project Report (Final).docx` - Final project report with detailed analysis and findings.

## Key Findings
- K-means clustering effectively identified usage patterns.
- Complex factors, including socio-economic, influence taxi service trends.
  
## Future Work
The project suggests integrating real-time data analysis and further assessing environmental impacts for comprehensive urban transportation planning.

## How to Use
1. Download the datasets from the `data/` directory.
2. Explore the Jupyter notebook for data analysis and machine learning models.
3. Review the final report for a detailed understanding of the project findings.
