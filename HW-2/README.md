# CSE 519 - Data Science (Fall 2023)

## Homework 2: Exploratory Data Analysis in iPython
**Professor**: Steven Skiena

**Due Date**: Thursday, September 28, 2023

### Overview:
This repository contains the solution for Homework 2 focused on conducting exploratory data analysis using iPython. The task revolves around the CommonLit Challenge on Kaggle, which evaluates the quality of written summaries produced by grade school children. 

The main objectives are:
- Conducting data exploration to uncover interesting observations about student summaries.
- Building baseline models for evaluation.

### Dataset:
The dataset is sourced from the CommonLit Challenge on Kaggle.

### Files:
1. `cse519_hw2_lastname_firstname_sbuid.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing the entire workflow, from data loading to model evaluation.
2. `cse519_hw2_lastname_firstname_sbuid.py`: Python script version of the notebook.
3. `cse519_hw2_lastname_firstname_sbuid.pdf`: PDF version of the notebook for easier viewing.

### Instructions:
The detailed instructions for this homework can be found within the `.ipynb` notebook file. Briefly, the tasks involve:
- Loading and joining datasets
- Feature engineering
- Data visualization
- Model building and evaluation
- Kaggle submission (optional)

### Tools & Libraries:
- **Python**: The primary programming language used.
- **pandas**: For data manipulation.
- **scikit-learn**: For building machine learning models.
- **numpy**: For numerical operations.
